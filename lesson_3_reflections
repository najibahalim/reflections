When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Its good to collaborate with others. It brodens our scope, gives us new ideas and encourages development.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually helps when we want to get certain branches after we complete our part of code to merge with someone else's code.
    Auto updating can be sometimes annoying.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks help in cloning a repository on github itself.
Its used when we want to work/modify/use someone else's repository on Github.
    Clones make a copy of a repository locally
Cloning is used to make a copy of a repository on Github locally for development.
    Branches are a diversion from the main flow of the code to develope a certain feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   Can be useful for tracking changes done by us locally when collaborating on Projects.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without using Git or Github I can collaborate using emails or whatsapp. But it may be quite Tedious and using GitHub will be much more easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

   Using seperate branches help when we go off track from the mainstream to develope a new feature.
Making changes in master branch is essential especially when we change the code that controls the main flow of the program.
